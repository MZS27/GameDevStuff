  storyText: 'You run like your life depends on it. Chef Mario chases you but is
    not able to keep up.


    As you continue running, you turn a corner and slam
    into the principal!


    The principal, now seething with rage, calls your Math
    teacher to ask what you were doing outside your class.


    Upon learning about
    your homework delays on top of slamming him in the school hallway, he suspends
    you for three weeks.


    The End [Slam Ending]'
