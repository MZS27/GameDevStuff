  storyText: 'You make your way back to class but you''re very late. Your Math teacher
    is furious at you for not doing your homework and being late on top of that.


    You''re
    taken to the principal''s office and since this is your third strike this year,
    you get a two week suspension.


    Maybe you can cook up a better plan next
