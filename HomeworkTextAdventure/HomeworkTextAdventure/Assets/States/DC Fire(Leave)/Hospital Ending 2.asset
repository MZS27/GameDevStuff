  storyText: 'You open your eyes and feel a sting of pain in your head. You recall
    being hit by something heavy when you left the classroom during the school fire.


    You
    have woken up in the hospital a day after the incident. You got some head injuries
    but luckily, you suffered no brain damage.


    The Math homework submission
    will still be overdue when you return. Maybe you will get it done by then.
