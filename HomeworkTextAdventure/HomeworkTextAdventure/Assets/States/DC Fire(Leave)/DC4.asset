  storyText: 'Mrs. Strupp begins walking back towards the classroom board. "You expect
    me to believe that after a long time, you finally finished your work and you
    forgot to bring it to school? That too on a day when you risk suspension for
    not submitting it?"


    "You probably think that suspending you for such a
    small mistake is silly. But I don''t see it as any different from giving you
    a quick harsh punishment instead."


    "After all, you don''t seem to have
    a problem in going through all this hell just so you can avoid doing a few pages
    of homework"


    1) "I''m trying my best".

    2) "I''m not made for doing
    homework."'
