  storyText: 'As soon as you exit the classroom you hear cracking and popping noises
    right above you. Whack! You feel something heavy hit your head.

    your eyes and find yourself back in your classroom. Mrs. Strupp is standing near
    you with a folded book in her hand which she seems to have swatted your head
