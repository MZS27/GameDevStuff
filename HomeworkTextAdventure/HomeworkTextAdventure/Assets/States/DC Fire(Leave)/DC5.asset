  storyText: 'Mrs. Strupp calmly responds "No kid likes doing homework. You''re not
    special here. I know that it''s not easy for everyone to sit and focus. And to
    follow a good work ethic on top of that regularly. But that doesn''t let you
    off the hook. If you cannot get those small habits in order today, it will be
    very difficult for you to do so when you grow up."


    "No matter how trivial
    or useless you think doing your homework is. No matter how much difficulty you
    face in getting the willpower to do it. It is your responsibility right now as
    a student, to do so. Not doing your homework is obviously not some terrible crime,
    but when you keep shirking off your responsibilities, they keep piling up. Eventually,
    you get crushed under their weight"


    "I will not take you to the principal
    today. Just promise me you will try to do better"


    1) "I promise"

    2)
    "I will try"'
