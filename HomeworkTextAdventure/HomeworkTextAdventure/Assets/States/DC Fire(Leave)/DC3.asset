  storyText: 'Mrs. Strupp sighs and continues "You have delayed submitting a simple
    assignment for weeks, you are frequently late to school, you sleep in class and
    show no interest towards your studies. So, I have decided to give you another
    chance and not take you to the principal''s office."


    Everyone in class
    has a confused look on their face as Mrs. Strupp continues "I know that this
    homework business has you very much troubled. Threatening you with even the worst
    kinds of punishment doesn''t seem to make much of a difference overall. I am
    going to forgive you this time. I want you to promise me that you will work to
    get past whatever is troubling you in your life. Once you start putting in the
    work, I know you will become the excellent student you are capable of being."
