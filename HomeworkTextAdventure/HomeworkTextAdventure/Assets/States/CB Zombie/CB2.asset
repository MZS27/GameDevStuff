  storyText: "You're assembled in the school ground with the others. The principal
    takes up the mic and says \"It looks like there has been a contamination in the
    food in our canteen. It tends to turn people into what you kids may call zombies...\"\r\n\r\nYou
    hear quite a lot of laughter in the ground and some murmuring over this silly
    announcement. \r\n\r\nAs he makes the announcement, some kids begin falling to
    the floor unconscious. Panicked, the principal and the teachers rush towards
    the exit.\n\r\n1) Rush towards the exit\r\n2) Wait around and see what happens"
