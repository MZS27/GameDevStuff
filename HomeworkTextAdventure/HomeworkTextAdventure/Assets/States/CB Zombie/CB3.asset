  storyText: 'As you run towards the exit, the unconscious students begin waking
    up. They start biting and ripping apart the flesh of other students. You see
    blood spewing everywhere and people running around screaming as the school ground
    becomes a battlefield.


    You reach near the exit but the door has been locked.
    The teachers and the principal stand behind the locked fence watching the horror
    unfold.


    1) Climb the chain-link fence

    2) Scream at the adults and
    tell them to open up.'
