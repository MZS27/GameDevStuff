  storyText: 'You let out a loud scream and as your eyes open you look around you
    to find yourself back in your class. Your scream draws the attention of your
    entire class. Your Math teacher Ms. Strupp does not look happy.


    "Were you
    sleeping in my class again? And I presume you haven''t done your homework either?
    That''s it. You''re coming with me to the principal''s office."


    The principal
    along with your Math teacher, shut the gates on your academic life by suspending
    you for two weeks.
