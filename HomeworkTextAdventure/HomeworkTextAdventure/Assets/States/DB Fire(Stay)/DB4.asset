  storyText: 'The ceiling begins to crumble and fall and you get trapped under some
    heavy debris. The weight of the debris is too heavy to lift it off alone and
    there is no one around that can help. All the dust and smoke in the air also
    make it very hard to breathe. You find yourself gasping for breath and about
    to pass out.


    1) Close your eyes and try to snap out of this nightmare'
