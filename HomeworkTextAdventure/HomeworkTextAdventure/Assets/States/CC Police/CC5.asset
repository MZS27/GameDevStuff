  storyText: 'The officer closes the classroom door and locks it shut.


    "You
    think this is funny? I don''t want to deal with all the bullshit of having you
    arrested and taken to court. I can end this right now."


    He takes a rope
    and starts tying it to the ceiling fan. It looks like he is making a noose to
    hang someone.


    You try to run away but fail. The officer grabs you and makes
    you stand on top of a desk as you come face to face with the noose.


    1)
    "Please believe me, it wasn''t me".

    2) Scream for help'
