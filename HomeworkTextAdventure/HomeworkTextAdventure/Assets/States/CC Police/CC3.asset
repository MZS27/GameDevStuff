  storyText: '"A rat huh? We will see about that."


    The officer walks over to
    your seat and begins checking your bag. He peruses through the bag for a while
    and finds nothing.

    After a while, he starts looking defeated until he checks
    the side pocket. He pulls out a bottle of rat poison.


    "Looks like it was
    a rat after all."


    1) "It wasn''t me, officer, I was framed"

    2) Say
    "I did it. I killed him" and do an evil laugh'
