  storyText: 'You reached the washroom. You can hear some noise coming from the inside.
    As soon as you walk in, everyone turns silent  You see a guy in a red hoodie
    giving you a weird stare.


    You see a lit cigarette butt on the floor. What
    do you do?


    1) Stomp on it and extinguish it

    2) Pretend not to notice
    it and just go about your business.'
