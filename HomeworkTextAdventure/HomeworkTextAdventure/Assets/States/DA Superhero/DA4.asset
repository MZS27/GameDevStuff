  storyText: "You're about to exit the school and head towards the ground when you
    hear screaming noises coming from behind. You turn around and see the red hoodie
    kid coming down the corridor setting everything in his path on fire. He seems
    to have a special ability that helps him generate fire with his hands. \r\n\r\nHe
    sees you and gets even more fired up. He shouts \"You! It was you who ratted
    me out to the principal wasn't it? I'm gonna kill ya.\"\r\n\r\n1) \"What in the
    world are you talking about?\"\r\n2) \"Stop this\""
